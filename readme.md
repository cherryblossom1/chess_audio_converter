# Chess Music Generator

This project is a Chess Music Generator that converts chess game moves into musical notes. It parses chess games from PGN files and generates a musical composition based on the moves played in the game. Each move corresponds to a specific musical note, creating a unique melody for each game.

## Contents

- `gui_interface.py`: The main Python script that provides a graphical user interface for selecting PGN files, parsing the chess moves, and playing the generated music.
- `pgn_files/`: Directory containing sample PGN files used for testing the Chess Music Generator.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the required Python libraries and their versions for running the project.

## Usage

1. Run the `gui_interface.py` script.
2. Click on the "Select File" button to choose a PGN file.
3. Click on the "Parse" button to parse the chess moves and generate the music.
4. Click on the "Play" button to play the generated music while visualizing the chess board.
5. Use the "Quit" button to exit the program.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run this project. Install them using `pip`:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Feel free to explore and experiment with different chess games to generate unique musical compositions!
